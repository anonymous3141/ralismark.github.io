Hi, I'm Timmy Yao. Welcome to my website.

I'm a 1st year computer science student at UNSW.

Right now, the most complete part is [my blog](/posts.html), where I posts stuff related to:

- [competitive](/2019/05/28/edge-trees.html) and [non-competitive](/2019/01/04/bluehid-1.html) programming
- [maths](/2019/04/05/speed-of-light.html)
- as well as the occasional [interactive post](/2019/05/24/fenwick-tree.html).

# Elsewhere on the internet

I'm called ralismark on all of these places:
