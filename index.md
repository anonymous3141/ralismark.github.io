Hi, I'm Timmy Yao. Welcome to my website.

I'm a 1st year computer science student at UNSW.

Right now, the most complete part is [my blog](/posts.html), where I posts stuff related to:

- [competitive programming](/2019/05/28/edge-trees.html)
- [non-competitive programming](/2019/01/04/bluehid-1.html)
- [maths](/2019/04/05/speed-of-light.html)
- as well as [tools](/2019/01/09/imgtools.html) and [other interactive things](/2019/05/24/fenwick-tree.html).
