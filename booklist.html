	<h1>Booklist</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>This book list is a work in progress! I haven’t fully entered the entries from the list I sent to my friend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One day, a friend asked for book recommendations and I wrote up a 400 word summary. This seemed like something that would interest others, so I started cleaning it up and put it on my website.</p>

<p>There are two Hacker News posts which have a lot of great book recommendations, and they’re also good places to look:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22718592">Ask HN: Great fiction books that have had a positive impact on your life?</a>, and</li>
  <li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23151144">Ask HN: Mind bending books to read and never be the same as before?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I also read a bunch of blogs, such as Slate Star Codex – you can find a nicely typeset copy of some posts at <a href="https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/">https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/</a>. I intend to create a larger blogroll at some point.</p>

<h2 id="algorithms-to-live-by"><a href="#algorithms-to-live-by">Algorithms to Live By</a></h2>

<ul class="li-flat">
  <li><em>Brian Christian, Tom Griffiths</em></li>
  <li><a href="https://algorithmstoliveby.com/">algorithmstoliveby.com</a></li>
  <li>Read around 2016</li>
</ul>

<p>Applying ideas from computer science &amp; adjacent fields to real life. The ideas and concepts introduced are useful ways to view the world and to improve yourself – for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">Explore / Exploit tradeoff</a>. I found this several years ago and really enjoyed it. Definitely a book I would re-read.</p>

<p>I also found a more extensive review about its usefulness – <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/62PRkMtu5jiBA9wLN/what-i-got-out-of-algorithms-to-live-by"><em>What I got out of ‘Algorithms to Live By’</em></a>.</p>

<h2 id="code-the-hidden-language-of-computer-hardware-and-software"><a href="#code-the-hidden-language-of-computer-hardware-and-software">Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</a></h2>

<ul class="li-flat">
  <li><em>Charles Petzold</em></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code:_The_Hidden_Language_of_Computer_Hardware_and_Software">wikipedia</a></li>
  <li>Read around 2016</li>
</ul>

<p>A very approachable exploration of low-level computer hardware, building up a CPU from circuits and logic gates. I read this a <em>long</em> time ago in high school, but I remember liking it – I followed it and was able to make a basic but working CPU in Logisim<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="the-fifth-science"><a href="#the-fifth-science">The Fifth Science</a></h2>

<ul class="li-flat">
  <li><em>Exurb1a</em></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GTMYVZF">amazon</a></li>
  <li>Read early 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>A collection of interesting stories using a soft sci-fi world to explore philosophical topics. Cool enough that I’m seriously considering re-reading it – and I usually don’t reread books.</p>

<p>Have a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Exurb1a">exurb1a’s youtube videos</a>, in particular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um6cGuJ4mNE">The Lantern</a>, which is a chapter from this book, to see if you’ll like it.</p>

<h2 id="the-prince-of-milk"><a href="#the-prince-of-milk">The Prince of Milk</a></h2>

<ul class="li-flat">
  <li>Exurb1a</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Prince-Milk-Exurb1a/dp/1983699748">amazon</a></li>
  <li>Read early 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>A really strange story with magic and philosophy.
Same characteristic style as Exurb1a’s other works, but I found the narrative quite hard to follow and mostly just confusing.</p>

<h2 id="foundation"><a href="#foundation">Foundation</a></h2>

<ul class="li-flat">
  <li><em>Isaac Asimov</em></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(Asimov_novel)">wikipedia</a></li>
  <li>Read mid 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>A futuristic story following intelligent characters who influence societies. Asimov creates a really good sense of scope from the high-level sweeps of history and politics, and the plot is not too simple. Only downside is that it feels like the protagonists’ plans are made foolproof by Plot Magic, but the positives definitely make up for this.</p>

<h2 id="nineteen-eighty-four"><a href="#nineteen-eighty-four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a></h2>

<ul class="li-flat">
  <li><em>George Orwell</em></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">wikipedia</a></li>
  <li>Read late 2018</li>
</ul>

<p>A classic must-read book. Like seriously, you have to read it if you haven’t already.</p>

<h2 id="the-rest"><a href="#the-rest">The rest</a></h2>

<p>Other than the ones above with longer reviews, I’ve also read</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Brave New World</em>, in early-mid 2020</li>
  <li><em>Ready Player One</em>, in 2017</li>
  <li><em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, in 2018</li>
  <li><em>The Science of Interstellar</em>, in 2017</li>
  <li><em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>, in 2019</li>
  <li><em>Map and Territory</em> of the Rationality: A-Z series, in late 2020</li>
  <li><em>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</em>, in late 2020</li>
  <li><em>Making Money (Discworld)</em>, in 2020</li>
  <li><em>Going Postal (Discworld)</em>, in 2019</li>
</ul>

<p>I may write a more extensive review for them in the future.</p>
